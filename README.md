### ðŸ’¡   Notes About Forked Repo User Vs. Collaborators

> :white_check_mark: Collaborators are those user which are <ins>TRUSTED</ins> by original repository owner, While  forked repository user is <ins>UNTRUSTED</ins>.

> :white_check_mark: If your repository is forked by another user and when they submit the pull request for original user, it don't trigger a WF ( Work-Flow ) run. Since they need to be approved by the original user first and then only it will trigger the WF.

> :white_check_mark: Instead of above fork repository UseCase, if you have **Collaborator** ( A User which is TRUSTED by Original Repo Owner Once Approved ) then, if he opens the ( PR ) Pull Request for same repo for which he is approved collaborator then It will certainly Trigger WF for it.
